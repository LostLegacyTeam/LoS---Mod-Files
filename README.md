# Usage
If you haven't already, extract your ISO for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG using [Sonic '06 Toolkit](https://github.com/HyperPolygon64/Sonic-06-Toolkit).
### Sonic '06 Mod Manager (recommended)
To install Legacy of Solaris onto your copy of SONIC THE HEDGEHOG, you will need [Sonic '06 Mod Manager](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Sonic-06-Mod-Manager). Clone to repository to your drive (or just click Download ZIP) and put the Legacy of Solaris folder in your mods directory. Then tick the mod from Sonic '06 Mod Manager and click Save and Play (or Install Mods for FTP).
# Xenia
### DirectX 12
For DirectX 12, no additional steps are required to run Sonic '06 optimally, this branch of Xenia as of now works well with SONIC THE HEDGEHOG. However, you may notice the occasional texture memory corruptions and/or vertex explosions, if those occur please press F4.

### PS3 Version Announcements

- The PS3 version has been scaled back in terms of extra content and changes in comparsion to the 360 version of the mod. The amigos no longer have extra mini stories, to compensate I left the stories for Sonic,Shadow and Silver completely unaltered. The gems in sonic's story are no longer buyable until the point they normally are (before Kingdom Valley), the e3 HUD is not part of the PS3 version as the sprite arc has had comptability problems with the PS3 version before.
