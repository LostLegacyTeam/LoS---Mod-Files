# Usage
If you haven't already, extract your ISO for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG using the [Sonic '06 Toolkit](https://github.com/HyperPolygon64/Sonic-06-Toolkit).

To install Legacy of Solaris onto your copy of SONIC THE HEDGEHOG, you will need the [Sonic '06 Mod Manager](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Sonic-06-Mod-Manager). Clone this repository to your drive (or just click Download ZIP) and put the Legacy of Solaris folder from the ZIP (**NOT** the `LoS-Mod_Files_X-master` folder) into your mods directory. Then check the mod in the Sonic '06 Mod Manager's mod list and click `Save, install content and launch Sonic '06`.

For extra information on setting up SONIC THE HEDGEHOG mods, check the [Mod Manager's wiki](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Sonic-06-Mod-Manager/wiki).

### PS3 Version Announcements

- The PS3 version has been scaled back in terms of extra content and changes in comparsion to the 360 version of the mod. The amigos no longer have extra mini stories, to compensate I left the stories for Sonic,Shadow and Silver completely unaltered. The gems in sonic's story are no longer buyable until the point they normally are (before Kingdom Valley), the e3 HUD is not part of the PS3 version as the sprite arc has had comptability problems with the PS3 version before.
